GfG : Perfect Number

Given a number n, check if a number is perfect or not. A number is said to be perfect if sum of all its factors excluding the number itself is equal to the number. 

Examples:

Input: n = 6
Output: true 
Explanation: Factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6. Excluding 6 their sum is 6 which is equal to N itself. So, it's a Perfect Number.
Input: n = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5 and 10. Excluding 10 their sum is 8 which is not equal to N itself. So, it's not a Perfect Number.
Input: n = 11
Output: false
Explanation: Factors of 11 are 1, 11. Excluding 11 their sum is 1 which is not equal to N itself. So, it's not a Perfect Number.
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 109


Solution ::


class Solution {
    static boolean isPerfectNumber(int n) {
        // code here
        int sum = 1;
        if(n <= 0)return false;
        
        for(int i=2; i*i<=n; i++){
            if(n % i == 0){
                sum += i;
                 if (i != n / i) {  // Avoid adding n/i if it's the same as i
                    sum += n / i;  // Add the paired factor n/i
                }
            }
        }
        if(sum == n){
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
