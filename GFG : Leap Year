GFG  : Leap Year


You are given an Integer n. Return true if It is a Leap Year otherwise return false.

Examples:

Input: n = 4
Output: true
Explanation: 4 is not divisible by 100 and is divisible by 4 so its a leap year
Input: n = 2021
Output: false
Explanation: 2021 is not divisible by 100 and is also not divisible by 4 so its not a leap year
Constraints:
1<= n < 104


Solution :: 


class Solution {
    static boolean isLeap(int N) {
        // code here
           // Check if the year is a leap year based on the given conditions
        if ((N % 4 == 0 && N % 100 != 0) || (N % 400 == 0)) {
            return true;  // Return true for leap year
        }
        return false;  // Return false for non-leap year
    }
}
